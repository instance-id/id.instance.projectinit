# ProjectInit

 Project initialization script to define specific editor settings (Scripting backend, API level, default Build Target, Incremental GC, etc)"

##### Note: Out of the box, this is probably only useful to me, or if you use linux and desire the same settings.

In case you do want to use it, you can use one of the methods below.

If anyone else does want to use it and wants it to be customizable via an external config so it can be reused in multiple projects with settings other than the ones I have set, let me know.

Install via OpenUPM  
`openupm add id.instance.projectinit`

Unity Package Manager  
`https://github.com/instance-id/id.instance.projectinit#upm`

Tested on Unity versions: 2019.4, 2021.1
